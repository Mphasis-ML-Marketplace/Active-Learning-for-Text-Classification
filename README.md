# Active-Learning-for-Text-Classification

## Product overview

Active Learning for Text Classification  trains a text classification model using a small corpus of training data and provides the most appropriate samples from a huge corpus of unlabeled data to be annotated in order to improve the model accuracy significantly. Using Active Learning this algorithm helps in identifying the most effective data sample to be tagged first thus reducing the time and effort to build a usable Machine learning model.

## Product Highlight 

* Active Learning for Text Classification can be used for prioritizing the data labeling task and thereby drastically reduce the data tagging effort required to build a working Machine Learning model.
* This solution can be used to iteratively sample the right data points & train the Machine Learning model to  build a  supervised machine learning algorithm. It helps in identifying which samples to label first based on the rules learned by Machine Learning model. It uses Active Learning methodologies to select the right sample data points from unlabeled data to build a better performing machine learning model much faster.
* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
