# Active-Sampling-for-Text-Classification

## Product overview

Mphasis DeepInsights Active Sampling for Text Classification  trains a text classification model using a small corpus of training data and provides the most appropriate samples from a huge corpus of unlabeled data to be annotated in order to improve the model accuracy significantly. Using Active Learning this algorithm helps in identifying the most effective data sample to be tagged first thus reducing the time and effort to build a usable Machine learning model.

## Product Highlight 

* Mphasis DeepInsights Active Sampling for Text Classification can be used for prioritizing the data labeling task and thereby drastically reduce the data tagging effort required to build a working ML model.
* This solution can be used to iteratively sample the right data points & train the ML model to  build a  supervised machine learning algorithm. It helps in identifying which samples to label first based on the rules learned by ML model. It uses Active Learning methodologies to select the right sample data points from unlabeled data to build a better performing machine learning model much faster.
* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need Customized Deep learning and Machine Learning Solutions? Get in Touch!
