    "## Deploy Active Learning for Text Classification Algorithm Model Package from AWS Marketplace \n",
    "\n",
    "Active Learning for Text Classification  trains a text classification model using a small corpus of training data and provides the most appropriate samples from a huge corpus of unlabeled data to be annotated in order to improve the model accuracy significantly. Using Active Learning this algorithm helps in identifying the most effective data sample to be tagged first thus reducing the time and effort to build a usable Machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Learning for Text Classification can be used for prioritizing the data labeling task and thereby drastically reduce the data tagging effort required to build a working Machine Learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution can be used to iteratively sample the right data points & train the Machine Learning model to  build a  supervised machine learning algorithm. It helps in identifying which samples to label first based on the rules learned by Machine Learning model. It uses Active Learning methodologies to select the right sample data points from unlabeled data to build a better performing machine learning model much faster.\n",

    "The deployed solution has these **2 steps**: Training the algorithm and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>: The system trains on user provided text dataset.\n",
    "<li>: The train dataset must contain 2 files - \"train.csv\" and \"validation.csv\" with 'utf-8' encoding.\n",
    "<li>: The machine learning model is trained in the training step and once the model is generated, it can be used to sample data points from unlabelled data using active learning technique.\n",
    "<li>: The testing API takes a csv file \"unlabelled.csv\" from which the data points are sampled for human annotation.\n",
    "<li>: In the usage instruction notebook, the detailed steps are mentioned to before each cell.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**train.csv**\n",
    "<li>: train.csv must contain 3 columns - <b>ID</b>, <b>Text</b> and <b>Category</b>. The <b>ID</b> is a unique identification number associated with the text, <b>Text</b> will have textual data that needs to be categorized and <b>Category</b> will be class with the associated text.\n",
    "<li>: It is recommended to start with small amount of annotated data in train.csv and increase the training data size iteratively by sampling data points from unlabelled data.\n",

    "<li>:  The output will be a csv file with sampled data points from unlablled data. The output csv file will contain ID and the associated text sampled for human annotation.\n",
    "<li>: These sampled datapoints should be annotated, added to train.csv and removed from unlablled.csv before training the machine learning model again.\n",
